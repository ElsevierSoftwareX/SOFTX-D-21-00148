Introduction
============

The pyFIRI package is a Python3 implementation of the FIRI-2018 model. 
Technically, the pyFIRI package is an xarray-based wrapper around pre-calculated values. 
It calculates electron density values for the D-Region Earthâ€™s non-auroral ionosphere.

Input parameters are:
- Julian Day Number (day of year, in range [1..365]),
- solar zenith angle (degrees, [0..130]),
- spherical geographical latitude (degrees, [0..60]),
- solar radioflux index F10.7 (s.f.u., [75 .. 200]).

pyFIRI output is electron density values in units of (electrons / m**3).
No extrapolation is performed during calculations. So, input parameters values 
that are outside the above named ranges are not expected.

Installation
============

The pyFIRI package is an ordinary Python3 wheel which is deposited into PYPI index
( https://pypi.org/project/pyfiri/ ). Due to this, Due to this, the standard way to install 
is via the PIP.

The pyFIRI package should work with Python 3.6-3.8. If installing for Python 3.9, 
a few issues may happen due to SciPy and NumPy dependencies. In those cases you may need 
to pre-install NumPy and SciPy packages.

========================================
Obtaining the Python interpreter version
========================================

To get the version of Python interpreter, the following command should be used:

>>> python --version

The output should be like

Python 3.8.2

The exact Python version may differ on your machine.
